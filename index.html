            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Lucy. I grew up in Colorado, and moved to Seattle for school. I have a BA in Sociology from Seattle University and a Master's in Environmental Studies from The Evergreen State College. My work experience includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A bunch of retail & fast food jobs in high school & college</li>
                <li>Peer writing tutoring in college</li>
                <li>From the mailroom to the IT department of a law firm</li>
                <li>The IT department of another law firm</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When I'm not working, I like listening to podcasts, gaming, working in my balcony garden, and cleaning up after my cats Merry and Pippin.</p>

            <p>My main goal is to get a job doing things I like (like coding) while also helping to make the world better. Ideally, I'd like to work at an environmental consulting firm or nonprofit, or in city or state government.</p>

            <p>When I was a kid, my family took a lot of camping trips around the westner US. The 10 national parks we visited most often were:</p>
